## hcandersenr

The text comes with 5 different languages with 

- 156 in English,

The package comes with a dataset for each language with the naming convention `hcandersen_**`,
where `**` is a country code.
Each dataset comes as a data.frame with two columns; `text` and `book` where the `book` variable has the text divided into strings of up to 80 characters.

The package also comes with a dataset called `EK` which includes information about the publication date, language of origin and names in the different languages.
