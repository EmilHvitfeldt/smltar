# Classification

## First attempt

### Look at the data

### Modeling

### Evaluation

## Preprocessing

Mostly the same, we still want to end with all numerics. 
Use keras/tensorflow to do preprocessing as an example.

## putting your layers together

## Use embedding

## Model tuning

## Case Study: Vary NN specific parameters

## Look at different deep learning architecture

## Case Study: Applying the wrong model

Here will we demonstrate what happens when the wrong model is used.
Model from ML-classification will be used on this dataset.

## Full game

All bells and whistles.
