# Regression

How are we handling this differently then classification in deep learning settings.

## First attempt

### Look at the data

### Modeling

### Evaluation

## Preprocessing

Mostly the same, we still want to end with all numerics. 
Use keras/tensorflow to do preprocessing as an example.

## putting your layers together

Express difference from classification model.

## Model tuning

## Look at different deep learning architecture

## Full game

All bells and whistles.
